# SubredditAnalysisTool
This is a tool meant to allow users to gain insights into sentiments inside reddit, specifically by conducting sentiment analasys on the comments in a subreddit.

If you have a machine that has a decent amount of ram, and is 64 bit, in line 65 of "sentiment_mod.py" replace "2500", with "5000". Then in lines 80, and 81, replace "5000", with "10000". This is to allow for better training of the machine learning algorithms by allwoing for a bigger data set to be processed.
