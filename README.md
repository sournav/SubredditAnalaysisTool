# SubredditAnalysisTool
This is a tool meant to allow users to gain insights into sentiments inside reddit, specifically by conducting sentiment analasys on the comments in a subreddit.

If you have a machine that has a decent amount of ram, and is 32 bit, in line 65 of "sentiment_mod.py" replace "5000", with 2500". Then in lines 80, and 81, replace "10000", with "5000". This is because some 32 bit versions of python may incur a memory error.
